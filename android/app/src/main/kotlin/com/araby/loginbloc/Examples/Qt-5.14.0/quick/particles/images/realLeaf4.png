80
Now what a stateless widget comes with is this method called Build and this method gets called whenever

40
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,700
we create a new version of this widget.

41
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:16,860
That means that if I go ahead and change this color from what was it teal to red and I click on the

42
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:24,420
hot reload button then it will go and check to see what was the code that was changed most recently

43
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,160
namely teal became red.

44
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:36,040
It will look to see where the closest build function is and it will re run it now that we've done this.

45
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,770
Let's go ahead and stop are up and run it again.

46
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,130
So we're restarting it from fresh.

47
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:51,360
And this means that our app is going to be created again using this stateless widget instead of simply

48
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:57,190
just returning a material app you can see right now our background has been changed to red.

49
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,660
But this is not very interesting.

50
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:04,640
We always knew that we could stop our app and run our app and wait a million seconds for that to happen.

51
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:11,530
But here's the cool thing now that we've got our material app inside a stateless widget which has a

52
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:17,920
build method which can be called every time we make a change to one of the widgets inside this build

53
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,800
method.

54
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,340
So let's change that color from red to blue.

55
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,440
This is the part of the code that will get marked as changed and as soon as I click on this button for

56
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:36,040
flutter hot reload you'll see that the changes move over almost instantaneously and it's because that

57
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:43,000
all the app is doing is instead of compiling all of the code linking everything together figuring out

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,980
where the app icons are which platform it's being run on instead of all of that it just calls this method

59
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:58,570
again and it rebuilds our material app with the scaffold with the changes.

60
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:06,840
This is why it can be so fast and remember that you don't actually have to click on this button by default

61
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:12,240
flutters hot reload is hard wired to happen when you save your project.

62
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,890
So let's change the color again.

63
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:21,060
Let's change it to white and as soon as I hit command s on mac or control us on windows and I save my

64
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:29,100
project it automatically runs hot reload and we get all the content refreshed almost immediately which

65
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:36,060
for anybody who's done any sort of mobile development with us android Zamir and whatever it may be this

66
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,250
is almost magical.

67
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:45,230
And the idea really is that hot reload is meant to happen so fast and it really is like a reload.

68
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,150
Like when you refresh your website as you're creating it.

69
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:55,620
And what this will allow developers to do is to almost paint their user interface into life.

70
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:55,900
Right.

71
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:02,370
Say if you were creating a drawing or creating a painting you see the changes immediately as soon as

72
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,520
your pen hits paper.

73
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:10,560
And even though hot reload is not instantaneous like when you put a brush on paper but it reduces that

74
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,520
lag to fractions of a second which means that developers are more inclined to use hot reload to see

75
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,300
the changes that happen after every change they make.

76
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,430
And this means that you get less errors because you haven't waited for a whole day before you rerun

77
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,790
your app and you realize that there's 10 things that have broken.

78
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,670
So we're going to be using the power hot reload to massively reduce the amount of time for each development

79
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,350
cycle.

80
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:43,770
So let's imagine a development cycle being we write code and then we test code we run it we see what

81
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:49,680
happens and then we look at the difference between what we expected to happen and what actually happens

82
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,170
on screen and then we go back and we change our code we write more code.

83
00:06:54,420 --> 00:07:02,220
And this goes on until infinity or until your app is done and what flutter allows us to do is to massively

84
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,310
shorten the time that's taken to create that cycle for each of those cycles.

85
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,670
And previously when you saw me creating this floating action button I created the button I hit save

86
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:21,750
it updates I changed the background color I hit save it update I add an icon to the button and I hit

87
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,750
save any updates as well.

88
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:30,510
So for every single line of code when I'm creating the user interface I'm just painting it on to my

89
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:35,180
app and seeing the result in fractions of seconds at almost live.

90
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,690
This means that you can really experiment with how you want the screen to look.

91
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:46,680
Let's see if you know for example let's move this thing to the left a bit see how that looks or change

92
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:53,010
the color of that thing through you know all the rainbows of colors and see how that looks and see whether

93
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:59,430
if you like it if not change it and then it updates in a fraction of second when we're developing apps

94
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,980
natively for Iowa or Android.

95
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:07,500
The only real option that we have is running the app from cold.

96
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:15,270
Now I want to show you even on a fast ISIS simulator running on one of the latest MacBook Pros.

97
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,350
So it has a lot of processing power.

98
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,180
I want to show you just how long this takes right.

99
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:26,190
So I'm stopping I'm starting and we're just watching that time ago and you can see in the console that

100
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,740
things are happening.

101
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,740
It's launching the code.

102
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,620
It's starting the build.

103
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:38,220
It's compiling our code turning the human readable code that we've written into ones and zeros that

104
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:44,230
the machine can actually understand and then launching our app onto the simulator.

105
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:52,070
And in total I counted that that took about 30 seconds to actually show up on the screen.

106
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,400
It really took a long time.

107
00:08:54,630 --> 00:09:01,290
And imagine that if you had changed just the color of the floating action button on the bottom right

108
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,730
you probably are not inclined to spend 30 seconds waiting to see how it's changed.

109
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:14,730
Right now let's consider if instead we were creating a flutter app and we now have access to our hot

110
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,870
reload.

111
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,070
Now the same thing.

112
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,590
Changing a color instead of hitting run.

113
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,990
I'm going to hit hot reload and it's a matter of seconds.

114
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:32,830
It took five seconds for that app bar background to change and the beauty of this is that it doesn't

115
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,740
even lose the state of the app.

116
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:40,840
So all of the things that you've done for testing say if I've changed the number of donuts eaten in

117
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:47,140
the app it's reading as ten but I decide to change the background color of the app bar to read and I

118
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,170
hit hot reload almost instantaneously.

119
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:57,250
My background color changes but the rest of the data that I input it hasn't reset itself which means

120
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:02,200
that if you're testing something like a form or you're testing something where you don't want to lose

121
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,380
the data that you've used to test the app but you wanted to make some sort of UI change then hot reload

122
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,950
won't lose that data for you.

123
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:17,020
And we're gonna see this come into action little bit later on as we get to develop more and more complex

124
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,000
apps.

125
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,460
Now what is this button that's next to the hot reload button.

126
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,030
This little green one.

127
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,540
Well this is something that comes with flutter as well.

128
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,700
And it's called a hot restart.

129
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:37,120
What this does is that it does in fact reset the state of your app.

130
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,630
So if you needed to test your app from the start.

131
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:47,490
So when number of donuts gets reset back down to zero then this is the button that you would use instead.

132
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,020
So I'm changing the background colour and then I'm pressing hot restart instead a hot reload.

133
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,590
And you can see that in the console it's doing exactly that.

134
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:02,920
Now it still doesn't take as long as actually starting the app from cold when you stop it and run it

135
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,650
again.

136
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:09,340
But it does in fact reset the state of our app and you can see that not only is this background gets

137
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:15,100
changed to blue but also the number of doughnuts eaten get reset back down to zero.

138
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,500
And it only took eight seconds for this to happen.

139
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:24,430
So you might be wondering well OK that's fair enough on a very simple app right.

140
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,550
Like you know something that just counts the number of doughnuts that you've eaten.

141
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,340
But what if I had a big app with thousands of lines of code then surely you know hot reload and hot

142
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,590
restart won't really be very useful for me.

143
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:43,510
Well actually it still is because of the way that hot reload and hot restart work what they do is they

144
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:51,550
will only look at the changes that were made and they will push those changes onto your testing device

145
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,710
your simulator or your iPhone.

146
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:58,550
It's almost kind of like if you're somebody like me who travels a lot.

147
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,850
I actually have a suitcase that's pre packed with pretty much all the things I always need when I go

148
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:09,940
travelling like toothbrush toothpaste my you know a couple of pair of socks and those kind of things

149
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,150
and depending on where I go I might add a few things or move a few things say if I'm going somewhere

150
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,420
that's quite warm I might add a pair of sunglasses.

151
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:26,650
So it's only the changes that I'm making to my suitcase that gets put into the suitcase and this means

152
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,490
I save myself a lot of time instead of packing my suitcase from scratch.

153
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:36,970
I'm only adding the changes that I need for a particular destination.

154
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,610
And this is how hot reload and hot restart works.

155
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:49,420
So in this case size doesn't actually matter it doesn't matter if you are packing for a small suitcase

156
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:56,470
or a giant suitcase as long as you're ready have the suitcase packed and you're only adding to it one

157
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:02,980
thing or two things depending on which destination you're going to then it doesn't actually take any

158
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,270
longer to pack a larger suitcase or a smaller suitcase.

159
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:14,440
And this is the same for our flutter code even if we're hot reloading for changes that we've made to

160
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,430
a really complex large project.

161
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:26,590
It will still be just as fast as doing it for a tiny project like this one here and in the coming lessons

162
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:33,520
we're gonna be using hot reload and hot restart to almost instantly see the changes that we're making

163
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,720
with our code in our simulator in the next lesson.

164
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,760
That's exactly what we're going to be building we're gonna be building out our container and seeing

165
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:48,460
all of the cool things that you can use it to do so for all of that and more I'll see you on the next

166
